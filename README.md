# project-seabass
App for handling inventory of tools, materials, patterns, recipes, etc. for small craft businesses (such as those found on Etsy.com).

### Introduction
I began the project for a specific client who is primarily a quilter. Naturally, I am using that client's store as a base model, but I am also trying to design the app in a way that can be tailored to others without a large degree of modification.

### Development
The application is being developed using Go on the backend, with Bootstrap and jQuery on the frontend.
