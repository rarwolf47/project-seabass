# project-seabass
Software for handling inventory of tools, materials, patterns, recipes, etc. for small craft businesses (such as those found on Etsy.com).

### Introduction
I began this project at the request of a local small craft business owner. So far all of the development I have doing has been done in an offline filesystem, but I am currently in the process of moving everything to this repo.
